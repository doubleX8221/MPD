Hi, I am an expert in C#, ASP.Net Core, ASP.NET Web API, jQuery, React, JavaScript, and Microsoft Web Development stack with more than 7 years of experience.

Experience:
I have more than 7 years of experience working over the Windows Azure & Microsoft Technology Stack: ASP.Net Core, ASP.Net MVC, React, C#.Net, MS SQL Server, MongoDB, JSON/XML, Web API, REST Services, ADO.Net, Database design, etc. I have worked on projects in multiple domains such as Finance, Supply Chain, E-commerce, etc. I have used EF, Dapper, etc. as ORM. Not only that, but I have also built my own Data Access Layer using reflection which is efficient, flexible, and maintainable. Therefore, I can work with any choice for DAL among these.

Among the frontend framework and libraries, I am well versed in React, Redux, jQuery, JavaScript, Razor, HTML 5, CSS, Bootstrap, etc.

I have vast experience working with AWS including EC2, S3 Bucket, AWS Code Deploy, Secrets Manager, etc.

I always adhere to SOLID principles. Not only that, but I am well-versed in Dependency Injection and have used it in multiple projects. I am also well-versed in Test Driven Development (TDD).

Commitment:
I like to focus completely on one project at a time. I will be working as an individual on your project, even though I have also managed a team in the past.

I think I am a good fit for this particular project because of the following points.

1. Have expertise in the technologies that are required for this project. This enables me to deliver a high-quality application.
2. Always give priority to my client's business and requirements.
3. Very much committed to my deliverables
4. Along with the deliverables, I always focus on the performance and maintainability of the code that I write

“High Quality + Fast Speed + Full Time + Faithful Development” is my motto. Look forward to hearing from you soon.
