I'm an experienced React Native developer with a passion for mobile app development, strong problem-solving skills, and an ability to quickly learn new technologies. I am eager to join a team of talented developers and help build world-class mobile apps.

Before coming to Upwork, I developed and maintained React Native components, screens, and features for the mobile app using TDD practices, and collaborated with other developers to implement new features in a way that is consistent with existing codebase conventions. In the meantime, I participated in design discussions regarding application architecture, feature implementation, or any other relevant topic as required.

Speaking in more detail, I developed a front-end user interface using React Native and JavaScript for iOS and Android mobile applications and utilized React Native debugging tools such as Reactotron and Remote JS to identify and fix bugs.

I'm sure my technical skills and experience will be helped to this project. Waiting for your reply and detailed discussion.
Thank you.

%Supabase

Hi, I experienced Supabase enough.
It supports several Front-End frameworks including Angular, Expo, Flutter, Ionic Angular, Ionic React, Ionic Vue, Next.js, Next3, React, RedwoodJS, SolidJS, Svelte, SvelteKit, and Vue3.

Supabase outperforms Firebase by up to 4x on the number of reads per second, and 3.1x on writes per second. Furthermore, it charges only based on the amount of data stored, not reads, writes, and deletes, but Firebase charges for reads writes and deletes too. So to speak, Supabase has two advantages - low price and high speed. So I prefer Supabase to Firebase.

I'm well versed in Supabase applications that are collaborated with all kinds of front-end frameworks, so please message me if you want to build your project completely.
Thank you in advance.

%Supabase

===== Write a usage of Supabase with a simple line.

It's an open-source alternate platform to Firebase where it provides all the backend services you may require to build an app.

===== Describe your recent experience with similar projects

I am quite familiar with Supabase and alternatives such as Firebase, etc. With Supabase, we can fluently import a CSV or copy and bury a spreadsheet to kickstart the design. This is great if we’re migrating data from another platform to Supabase. Firebase does not offer inbuilt services that enable us to directly upload bulk data. The stylish we can do is use a third-party knot script or commodity analogous, which looks hackish. Plus, we will have to convert our CSV( or whatever format) to JSON before doing anything at all.

I have done several apps whose backends rely on BaaS, including chat and social networking applications. I am in the programming world for over a decade now. With a Computer Science degree and a passion for always solving problems, I am a self-motivated person with the ability to take any challenge and make project execution successful.

In my past experience, I have worked with native iOS and Android frameworks with both languages for each that they support, i.e. Objective C, Swift and Java, Kotlin respectively.

In terms of React, I have been building and publishing apps on Android and iOS using React Native framework since 2015. Keeping in mind my previous background with almost a decade’s experience in mobile app development, I consider myself a well fit for any position to build scalable and high-performance applications.

I am an expert at source version controlling and project management methodologies especially with agile. This experience gives me a clear edge over most of the candidates and I am confident that I surely outperform and exceed my client's expectations with the level of skill I have - this makes me bring a full package to the table as an engineer.

Looking forward to working with you!

The stylish we can do is to use a third-party knot script or commodity analogous, which looks hackish. Plus, we will have to convert our CSV (or whatever format) to JSON before doing anything. Supabase is good because it's a relational database and an alternative to Firebase which is a NoSQL DB, it is open source and the DB that it uses is PostgreSQL. Though it provides a rigid DB, there is a real-time functionality that is not secure, and also it is not ready for production yet.

Hi, Your job post shoots out to me since it's extremely similar to the work I've provided for my previous clients. I have worked on some team projects and have launched many mobile applications to Google Play and App Store successfully using React Native.

For the project to succeed, we have to make the code quality and update the libraries to the latest ones.

One example of similar projects I've handled is:
Plankk (https://plankk.com/our-apps/), where I successfully helped my client. They have many fitness influencers and wanted many applications (iOS & Android) for them and I have contributed to their iOS, and Android applications using Swift, Kotlin, and React Native. I contributed to all phases of their application development life cycle for mobile applications including planning, design, testing, deploying, and project support. Especially, I have helped them raise their new strategy by making the React Native Template of their application.

Some of my other examples are:
https://skylove.su/ (React Native, Firebase, Twilio API, etc.)
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wecode.hafmob (Kotlin, Swift, React Native, Firebase, AWS)

I love what I do and love to help others reach their goals. I look forward to discussing your project further. Thank you for your time.
