Hello,

If you're looking for clean, neatly written code and great communication culture, then I am ready to help you with my expertise in this field.

I have 5+ years of experience in flutter/iOS/android app development. I can handle your app A to Z level work by handling UI design, backend, and front end till android and iOS app submission.

How I will process it?
- First, I will provide a complete clickable UI based on your requirements to know how your app will work. (If the client provides this then I can skip this.)
- Once you approve the UI then start the development.
- Each week Work Demo with Android or iOS (Whatever Prefer client)
- Testing with major devices And submission on Stores.

Some of my best apps:
— Filmr: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.filmrapp.videoeditor&hl=en&gl=US

If you like what you see, leave me a note and let’s further discuss the project at hand in detail.
Looking forward to your reply!

Thank you.
