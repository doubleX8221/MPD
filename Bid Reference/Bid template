One sunny day, a wolf 🐺 and a rabbit 🐰 crossed paths on a winding trail. The wolf turned to the rabbit and asked with a cheeky smirk, "Hey, what's one plus one? 🤔" The rabbit, shaking with fear 😨, replied, "It's two..." Suddenly, the wolf snarled 😈, pounced on the poor rabbit, and declared, "You know too much! So, you must be silenced!" 😱😂

😀👋Hi, After reading your Job post, I have full passion to work with you.👍👌

With my extensive experience in website and tool development using ReactJS and ExpressJS, I am confident that I can take over the project from the previous developer and make the necessary code modifications in Phase 2 to deliver a high-quality web-based tool.

I understand that the successful candidate will also need an advanced knowledge of Microsoft Excel, which I possess. I am experienced in using Excel for complex calculations and can replicate its functionality in JavaScript as needed for the web-based tool project.

For the project, I propose the following milestones:

Milestone 1: Takeover of the project and code - 2 days
In this phase, I will thoroughly review the codebase and ensure that I have a clear understanding of the complete project requirements. I will be performing any necessary code-cleaning, refactoring, and testing.

Milestone 2: Modifications to the web-based tool using ReactJS and ExpressJS - 3 weeks
During this phase, I will get in detail the spec and requirements for the next phase to make the code modifications necessary to bring the project to its completion.

Milestone 3: Testing and Deployment - 1 day
In this final phase, I will perform thorough testing to ensure that the web-based tool is functioning according to the project requirements. I will then deploy the website to the production server, ensuring that it is ready for use.

I am confident that I can deliver a high-quality web-based tool that meets your specifications. Please let me know if you require any additional information or clarification.

“High Quality + Fast Speed + Full Time + Faithful Development” is my motto. 
Really attracted to this job. 
I am available to discuss the opportunity in more detail via interview and look forward to the possibility of working with you.
Thank you.

I'm located in a timezone that is compatible with France, so scheduling should not be an issue. It would be helpful to see the mockups and estimate file to get a better understanding of the project's scope.

I'm excited to work with your team, including the CTO, lead developer, and project manager.
