Hi, there.

I have been working as a React/Next.js developer for over 7 years.

As a React/Next.js engineer(7 years of experience), I've extensive experience in React Hooks, Redux for state management, and its related libraries & packages.

I'm also proficient in writing REST APIs on the back-end and integrating them into the front-end.

Please see my web development related skills:

▪️ JavaScript (ES5/ES6) , TypeScript , HTML5, CSS (CSS3, LESS/SCSS, SASS), React/Next.js, Nuxt, Vuex, Vue, Angular, Redux, Svelte
▪️ Material UI, Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation, Ant Design, Reactstrap, Semantic UI
▪️ AWS S3, EC2, Lambda, etc
▪️ MongoDB, MySql, PostgreSQL etc

📌 My Main skills are the rapid development and precision to the details that make me different from others.

📌 Communication is one of the main factors in remote working, and I always keep daily updates during the project & test upon completion.

I can start working right now with 40 hours of availability in your time zone, so feel free to message me anytime.

Thank you for your time.
