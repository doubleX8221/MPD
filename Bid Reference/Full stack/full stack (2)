Hi there,

You product sounds very interesting and exciting!

I have experience of working on a live auction platform:
https://phillips.com

I think my background in crypto industry can make me a good fit.

Shall we connect and discuss further?

Thanks,
William


Hey, if I am getting this correctly, you need a website where anything that is on sale is actually posted as a video / a stream, and users watch this and place their bids on it. If this is the case I have done something very very similar and I am actually building the app for it {can provide the whole detail on it if you need it}. So adding a smart contract won't be an issue. However, I would need to know more details, you mentioned Squarespace? Is the current website developed in Squarespace because that can cause issues? So let me know if we can have a call and discuss this thoroughly.

have a look at these couple of projects that I have worked on and developed:
https://gwallet.tech/ {A complete exchange}
https://dreamerz.io/ {NFT market place with mystery box features}
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cryptokara&hl=en&gl=US A complete wallet app.

Thanks!
