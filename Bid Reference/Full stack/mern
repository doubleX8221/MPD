Hello,

I have been working as a Full Stack(MERN) engineer for over 5 years.

As a React engineer(6 years of experience), I've extensive experience in React Hooks, Redux for state management, and its related libraries & packages.

I'm also proficient in writing REST APIs on the back-end and integrating them into the front-end.

I can start working right now with 40 hours of availability in your time zone, so feel free to message me anytime.

Thank you for your time,
Rosu
