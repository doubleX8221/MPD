Hi, this is Cameron.

I have been working as a Full Stack(JavaScript) engineer for over ten years.
Recently, I've specialized in MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js and am also good at social networking.
As a React engineer(6 years of experience), I've extensive experience in React Hooks, Redux for state management, and its related libraries & packages.
I'm also proficient in writing REST APIs on the back-end and integrating them into the front-end.

Would you mind looking at one of my MERN(TypeScript) projects?
https://app.titano.finance/
Titano Finance is a DeFi application with the Titano Autostaking Protocol or TAP.
The main challenge was making updates to an existing legacy platform that was difficult to maintain, support, and improve due to its architecture, underlying technology, and design.
Most of the original code was refactored to make it more modular & reusable and wrote form-based pages to dynamically change as the data was updated or REST API was queried.

? My Main skills are the rapid development and precision to the details that make me different from others.

? Communication is one of the main factors in remote working, and I always keep daily updates during the project & test upon completion.

I can start working right now with more than 40 hours of availability in your time zone, so feel free to contact me anytime.

Best regards,
Cameron.
