Hello,

As a JavaScript specialist, I have rich experience in developing web applications and Rest APIs using Node.js, Nest.js, Express.js and Serverless framework with TypeScript. And their customization, subsequent support, and promotion is my area of expertise. Also, I am very familiar with MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

I get into details before proceeding with any work that may end up wasting both parties' time and am efficient, creative, and open-minded to suggest new ideas and alternatives to clients based on what they need as the final product.

In order to prove my experience please take a look at the projects below:

Looking forward to having an impressive interview with you soon.

Thank you so much.
