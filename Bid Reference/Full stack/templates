Hey there!
I am so excited by your job description.
This is the real opportunity for me to demonstrate my ability.
To say about your project, 
Can you give me the list of blockchains you want to integrate?
So, do you want to implement the provider using as little number of APIs as possible?

OK. Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best,


Alchemy

blockchains supported by Alchemy:
-Ethereum
-Polygon
-Optimism
-Arbitrum
-Solana

Sorry, I can' t understand about 'Z.'.
Do you mean z.com or HP Z?

While both Harmony and Near protocol seek to solve a similar goal, each project has its competitive advantage based on the infrastructure.
In interoperability, consensus mechanism, tokenomics and price action...
If you want more details, I can answer.
