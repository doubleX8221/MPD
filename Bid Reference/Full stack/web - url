Greetings!

I am an experienced web developer with expert-level skills in Python and JavaScript. I've got extensive knowledge and skills in Django, React, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Docker, and AWS.
Currently I have several web applications under my belt to demonstrate my ability to create full stack apps: an online store inspired by Steam using React, Redux, PostgreSQL, AWS S3, and Django; an easy to use music making app using MongoDB/Mongoose, Django, Express.js, React/Redux, and Node.js; and a simple yet fun game utilizing HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and GraphQL.

Please check the following I worked :
- https://aimusiclessons.com/

Technology Stack :
Having Django on the back-end and top coding skills, we could ensure fast, efficient development and craft well-performing application. With GraphQL development we were able to get from the API exactly what we needed and ensure fast, stable solution that controls the data it gets not the server.

While I'm willing and equipped to work on any kind of software development, I generally look for a full-stack development position. I am also a great team-player with good interpersonal relationship and great flexibility to meet the business needs. Please shoot me a message so we can discuss more details.

Regards,
Thomas

Hey! I recently ended my job as CTO at Buzz.ai
And now having a very lit team that is ready to hop on a new project

---------------------------------------------------------
Hi, this is Samuel.

I have been working as a Full Stack(JavaScript) engineer for over ten years.
Recently, I've specialized in MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
As a React engineer(6 years of experience), I've extensive experience in React Hooks, Redux for state management, and its related libraries & packages.
I'm also proficient in writing REST APIs on the back-end and integrating them into the front-end.

Would you mind looking at one of my MERN(TypeScript) projects?
https://app.titano.finance/
Titano Finance is a DeFi application with the Titano Autostaking Protocol or TAP.
The main challenge was making updates to an existing legacy platform that was difficult to maintain, support, and improve due to its architecture, underlying technology, and design.
Most of the original code was refactored to make it more modular & reusable and wrote form-based pages to dynamically change as the data was updated or REST API was queried.
Also, working as a front-end engineer, my goal was to implement interactive pages and functionalities to enhance platform stability and security.

📌 My Main skills are the rapid development and precision to the details that make me different from others.

📌 Communication is one of the main factors in remote working, and I always keep daily updates during the project & test upon completion.

I can start working right now with more than 40 hours of availability in your time zone, so feel free to message me anytime.

Best regards,
Samuel

I don’t usually look for new clients, but your post took my attention since I’ve recently finished a similar project using Python, Django, Typescript and Angular..

Here is what my recent client says:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Paul & his team are a real asset to the project - often on Upwork when you hire an engineer full-time you taking a lot of risk on - a freelancer might ghost you and for some reason, it happens at the most important parts of the project, might not have proper communication, might be outsourcing the work to someone else, at the end of the day he just might not write good code and not be efficient in what he does - worst-case scenario if he’s not tracking time properly & work just to bill you hours. With Paul we had no issues like that - the process he uses is awesome - daily stand-ups, regular check-ins, all-time clear communication, a separate tracking system that checks the activity & the tasks delivered is awesome - a new level of experience in comparison to everyone I’ve worked with on Upwork so far.”

Surely you’re looking for someone reliable, who can be with you all the time, have clear communication, someone who knows the industry very well & can consult you on implementations & security issues.

Maybe this will be a perfect fit for us. I expect people to give business their all, and I return the favor. If you’re truly passionate about this, let’s hop on a call.

There, I showcase my previous experience with regard to backend engineering & projects like yours.

I also provide case studies of some of my previous clients.

And lastly, I describe exactly the reasons why you should go with me, over someone else.

Reply to this message to set up a time to chat.

Kind Regards,
Paul

Hello,
We are a team of 24 engineers from Kyiv, Ukraine and we really need a new project. I would like to offer you our agency for your project, since we have a solid experience working with Python, Flask, Jango, async programming. Also we have quite a lot of experience working with JS-frameworks. Commonly using PHP-frameworks (Laravel and Symfony), Nest (Node, Express) for backend and JS-frameworks (React, Vue) for frontend tasks. MongoDB, MySQL, AWS, CQRS.

We have solid experience of creating back end using Node.js. Please check our recent project -
https://app.unifai.us/ - an application that allows upgrading Slack for sending and receiving audio messages.

We are constantly working with clients from different North-American time zones using Zoom, for example based MST, Arizona, so we are able to work or overlap some PST, MST, CST, EST hours.

Some Examples we developed using Python for backend tasks.:
https://kremenchug.prom.ua/ua/
- Leader of online trade in Ukraine. Consumer, industrial and wholesale goods from hundreds of thousands of proven sellers. Everything for your business, life and leisure.
https://edi.vchasno.com.ua/ - EDI
- Electronic data interchange, standardized e-mail exchange service between the customers and the suppliers.
https://gitlab.prozorro.sale/prozorro-sale
- Prozorro is a public electronic procurement system where state and municipal customers announce tenders to purchase goods, works and services, and business representatives compete for the opportunity to become a state supplier.

Some Examples we developed:
https://lines-of-stories.xyz/ - a social networking service targeted at event streams, developed in PHP for the back-end and React for the front-end. Currently officially still in development, but already functional.

https://viaduct.pro/projects/vinovest/
- Recently Viaduct has had a great opportunity and unforgettable experience to work with Vinovest (Los Angeles, California) using the React JS framework. Vinovest is a unique innovative digital platform that allows people all over the world to invest in rare and fine wine. Such investment is really unusual but at the same time has great potential today as we can see incredible demand for wine. Only in the last 12 months, the number of customers using Vinovest platform has increased about 1900%.

http://officeexchange.com
- Developed in PHP (using Laravel framework) for the back-end and JavaScript (using the ReactJS framework) for the front-end. Formally, it is still in the development stage, but gives the overall impression.

https://hyperdocs.co/
- The online education field has made a big breakthrough in a short time span. HyperDocs itself is a term that describes a GoogleDoc that functions as an educational worksheet. The main objective for the site was to create a hub for educators and digital learners who are actively implementing HyperDocs in teaching. A lot of times our team needed to think creatively in order to realize the vision Hyperdocs had and come up with practical solutions to challenges we had.

Our price policy is flexible, technical assignment and skills of our experts and technicians are adequate and competent. I would kindly ask you to provide us with all of your materials for accurate understanding what do you need.

Hi, nice to meet you!
My name is Mykola, I'm co-founder and CEO at Apiko - https://apiko.com/

Apart from full-cycle product development, we professionally provide staffing and recruiting services. We can help you by expanding your team with full-stack, frontend & backend, web, or mobile engineers as well as allocate part-time project managers, designers, DevOps, and QA specialists on demand. The team members will work on a T&M basis, and pricing depends on the seniority level of the candidates.

Could you please let me know if you are open to the allocation of at least two team members from our side? I’m asking since we created specific criteria for new projects:

- The predicted amount of billable hours: 1250+ (3 months of active development).
- The size of the team: 2 full-time developers or more (for every senior developer, there should be at least 1 full-time middle or junior developer).

Speaking of technologies, from the start, we decided to narrow our technical focus to become experts in JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and React Native. Here is the link to the detailed list of technologies we are skilled in - https://apiko.com/expertise/technologies/

Here is an example of smooth cooperation between our outsourced team and the client-side:

Hive - https://apiko.com/portfolio/hive-project-management-app / is our biggest project so far that has 100+ integrations including the one with SAP, and as a result, Hive raised 26 Million USD in investment so far. Currently, 25 of our engineers are working with the NY-based Hive team. They also mentioned our cooperation in the Forbes article about scaling the startup: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/12/30/from-five-to-50-growing-an-all-star-startup-team/?sh=6588ff1f4732

We would also like to highlight our DevOps support plan that differentiates us from other agencies. Follow the link to investigate more - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BxB4QaXSjM8ntP7E7BqZ5uAx09S0kisl/view?usp=sharing

Portfolio: https://apiko.com/portfolio/
Pricing:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RR1z6L53P3WTMvzaqotEAJi-r-ameJv-L35jRQa-DVQ/edit#heading=h.2vmhlrr7a8xm

We also want to emphasize that we are located in the Western part of Ukraine. As you may already know, Ukraine is experiencing russian military aggression that was initiated by russian government. Though Western Ukraine is currently considered one of the safest zones, we understand that your business may still face potential risks by choosing to work with us. We are ready to discuss and prepare the plan for their mitigation.

In case you are interested in my feedback, please contact me here, and I will be happy to discuss everything in more detail!

Warm regards,
Mykola Striletskyi

Hello, as I can see you are looking for independent freelancers to compose a team, however, you may consider outsourcing your project to a dedicated software development team which we may provide you with. In this case, instead of dealing with recruitment, employment, training as well as organizational tasks and project management you may solely focuse on building desired product.

Participating one of the most popular concerns our clients frequently have, I'd like to say straight away that you'll get a close-knit team of our employees instead of strangers who meet for the first time on your project in the event you decide to proceed with us. In our agency, we have very selective recruitment process where everyone undergoes 2-month paid internship. Then, everyone follows coherent and systematic approach to development which allows us demonstrate a fully functional deliverable every 1-2 days.

As for technologies, you may review a full list here: https://abz.agency/services-and-expertise/#database#nocontacts. In short, the main technical stack that we use for development is focused on working with these frameworks: PHP Laravel, Node.js, React.js, Vue.js. While working with UI / UX our designers use Wireframe Pro, Sketch, PhotoShop, Figma.

You can learn more at our company website: https://abz.agency/#nocontacts. But I would like to draw your particular attention to an article about dedicated team format: https://abz.agency/dedicated-team/#nocontacts.
(Please do not delete #nocontacts part at the end - per Upwork ToS updates from 26th of May 2020, all agencies and clients are prohibited from communicating outside of Upwork or provide any means of direct contact.)

Best regards,
Ihor, CEO of abz agency.

Hi. I have experience in developing Vue.js/Vuex web apps with Laravel backend for the last 6 years.
- Vue, VueX, Nuxt.js, Quasar, Vuetify, Vuely

• Proscia's Online Slide Viewer
https://proscia.com/concentriq-platform/ (Vue.js/Vuex/Vuetify)
Proscia's digital pathology platform is used to explore, annotate, and analyze whole slide images for clinical and research pathology. I was the sole front-end programmer for the refactor and redesign of Proscia's digital pathology platform. I rewrote the entire front end from scratch, eliminating five years of tech debt and reducing the repository size threefold.

During this process, I upgraded the platform to Vue 3, standardized the data store, and built a custom component library. I also built functional, snapshot, unit, and integration tests for the application and created a detailed list of user stories and acceptance criteria to make future development more stable.

• Monadnock Congregational Church
http://monadnockcongregational.com (Vue.js/Nuxt.js/TailwindCSS)

This was a pet project where I migrated a basic server-side CMS website to a client-generated Nuxt and TailwindCSS site.

Noteworthy features are under the hood. The website can be updated and published with a single script, compiling the Vue.js templates and sending the files to the webserver via FTP with a custom node script. A small PHP script retrieves Google Calendar information.

I would like to discuss your Vue.js web app functions in detail in the interview.
Thank you.

Swift for Native iOS application
Kotlin for Native Android application
React.js/HTML5 for the admin panel
Node.js for the server-side
Socket.io for real-time features and Chat
MongoDB for database

Proposed team

1-3 Developers, 1 Test Engineer, 1 Project Manager
We all sit at the same office to brainstorm and take decisions quickly.

I offer you a flexible Time & Materials (pay-for-time) engagement model. Approximate time of completion per task is estimated.
You are free to make any changes at any time up to your business needs.
Price is fact work hours tracked in a detailed timesheet and multiplied by an hourly rate of USD 49.99 (for full-time work from 200 hours, an additional 10% discount is provided for portfolio showcasing: USD 45).
Approximate estimation
A product that minimally realizes what you described - is 3 months and USD 19 200.
I estimate based on developed products with concepts like yours. This estimation is rough because so are the requirements.

Do you have any extra materials? If yes, please share - we will analyze and update the estimation.
If not, let’s shape your requirements together. I do it in 2 steps: a call, then wireframe. A more precise estimation after each.

Next step
Call - to clarify needs and update estimation.
I ask questions and write user stories. User stories are what each user can do. They clearer describe your requirements than functions or mockups.
It’s hard to say if a list of tech terms has all you need either. But what your users should do - you know for sure and see if anything is missed right away.
During the call, an update on technologies, user stories, and an estimate. They sum up into a more precise project estimation. If it suits, planning and wireframing go next.

After the call
Planning and wireframing - to make a usable product and save
Would you start building your house without a plan or a blueprint? Same with software products - wireframes are blueprints for them. We do them clickable: https://4et926.axshare.com/#g=1&p=welcome_screens&hi=1

Why draw them?

1. To make a more convenient product:
Developers ensure you get 100% money users pay you. Analysts ensure half of the users won’t give up ordering because it’s too complicated.

2. To save time and money on changes:
What costs USD 10 to re-draw might be USD 1000 to re-code. All my partners had new ideas when saw their product 1st time. It’s cheaper and quicker to apply them while planning. It’s possible because a wireframe you click through almost like with a ready product.

3. To save time and money on development:
Developers do not waste time asking how functions should work and look. So you get the product faster. Price is work hours multiplied by an hourly rate. So if you get it faster, you get it cheaper.
Like a house blueprint, any contractor can use the wireframe for estimation and development.

Based on what we know now, planning and wireframe will take from 10 days and cost from USD 1800.

To see more reference applications, go to “Portfolio” and “Filter by service” on the left: https://www.upwork.com/ag/forasoft/
We are excited to learn more about your vision & discuss how we can exactly partner with each other.

Would you like to have a call and discuss everything over a short call on Upwork?

I don’t usually look for new clients, but your post took my attention since I’ve recently finished a similar project.

Here is what my recent client says:

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “Eugene & his team are a real asset to the project - often on Upwork when you hire an engineer full-time you taking a lot of risk on - a freelancer might ghost you and for some reason, it happens at the most important parts of the project, might not have proper communication, might be outsourcing the work to someone else, at the end of the day he just might not write good code and not be efficient in what he does - worst-case scenario if he’s not tracking time properly & work just to bill you hours. With Eugene we had no issues like that - the process he uses is awesome - daily stand-ups, regular check-ins, all-time clear communication, a separate tracking system that checks the activity & the tasks delivered is awesome - a new level of experience in comparison to everyone I’ve worked with on Upwork so far.”

Surely you’re looking for someone reliable, who can be with you all the time, have clear communication, someone who knows the industry very well & can consult you on implementations & security issues.

Maybe this will be a perfect fit for us. I expect people to give business their all, and I return the favor. If you’re truly passionate about this, let’s hop on a call.

There, I showcase my previous experience with regard to web SaaS engineering & projects like yours.

I also provide case studies of some of my previous clients.

And lastly, I describe exactly the reasons why you should go with me, over someone else.

Reply to this message to set up a time to chat.

Kind Regards,
Eugene

I just read your posting which caught my attention as Software Development is my speciality!

I've worked with companies of all size, from startup to some of the top brands around the world on a wide variety of tasks like API integrations, App, Web and plugin development just to name a few.

I'm based in London and have been doing this for the last 14 years. I can help you with all aspects of your project from identifying your brand and design all the way through to the delivery of the development.

Hello! It looks like you need a professional Full-stack (Laravel, Vue) Developer. Look no further... 🙂 We have 20+ years experience in complex projects development.

One large-scale project we recently developed, is car insurance comparison CRM + Marketplace (Getpolis). We used PHP (Laravel) for back-end here and Vue for front-end. Here is a link to an article detailing our work on this project: https://orbitsoft.com/link/387443

Lets catch up by phone or Google Meet or Zoom! What time will work for you?

May the force be with you,

Hi, my name is furqan. As you are looking for some one having good knowledge of Vue, I have around 3 years of experience on vue.js and node js collectively. I have been working for Cellsmart as a remote developer and have developed their core app Cellsmart 4.0 on Vue js. Have used node js on backend while mocha and chai for unit testing on backend.

What I can bring to table ?
- sincerity to my role
- quick learning
- working on multiple projects in parallel.

Let me share some of the apps I have developed on vue.js ( using node as a backend Lang)

1- Cellsmart POS ( app.cellsmart.biz)
Fixing Bugs and adding complete features (both on front-end and back-end)
 unit & integration testing with Mocha and Chai
 Develop and execute unit, functional, integration testing of developed software components (backend)
 Worked on relational Database
 languages: node.js, vue.js, mysql

2- smplsale.com(wholesale distribution system mainly for wholesalers)
 Design and Implement low-latency, high-throughput wholesale web application with Node.JS/Express on the server side.
 Collaborated with the team using slack, trello and BitBucket
 Created Web APIs on Node JS to expose application data and make it shareable across applications.
 languages/tools/api's: node.js, express, sequelize ORM, mysql, sendgrid, stripe, amazon server

Other applications include
3- ccin.app( clock in out system for stores)
4- taleem.app ( A complete donation solution for ngos and schools)
5- dukan( an application to handle auction planed by government at different sites)
6- citizen helper( an application launched at times of covid situation in order to help fellow citizens those who are seeking for help)
And many more.
I am always passionate to bring new things on table by putting my efforts. Providing scalable and reliable code is always my priority. I hope it works out well to know a bit of me. We can surely have a meeting before we came to some contract. Waiting to hear from you soon.

Hi. I have experience in developing Vue.js/Vuex web apps with Laravel backend for the last 6 years.
- Vue, VueX, Nuxt.js, Quasar, Vuetify, Vuely

• Proscia's Online Slide Viewer
https://proscia.com/concentriq-platform/ (Vue.js/Vuex/Vuetify)
Proscia's digital pathology platform is used to explore, annotate, and analyze whole slide images for clinical and research pathology. I was the sole front-end programmer for the refactor and redesign of Proscia's digital pathology platform. I rewrote the entire front end from scratch, eliminating five years of tech debt and reducing the repository size threefold.

During this process, I upgraded the platform to Vue 3, standardized the data store, and built a custom component library. I also built functional, snapshot, unit, and integration tests for the application and created a detailed list of user stories and acceptance criteria to make future development more stable.

• Monadnock Congregational Church
http://monadnockcongregational.com (Vue.js/Nuxt.js/TailwindCSS)

This was a pet project where I migrated a basic server-side CMS website to a client-generated Nuxt and TailwindCSS site.

Noteworthy features are under the hood. The website can be updated and published with a single script, compiling the Vue.js templates and sending the files to the webserver via FTP with a custom node script. A small PHP script retrieves Google Calendar information.

I would like to discuss your Vue.js web app functions in detail in the interview.
Thank you.
