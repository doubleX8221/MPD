My recent experience is with Ilmiya. Where we as a team of 3 developers, and 1 UI/UX designer helped them build their app by being their extended technical arm. The project was managed on Asana and Jira. The project manager would take daily standup calls where each one would provide an update. We use to have a big meeting on Mondays to decide weekly goals and deadlines. We followed the Agile model for design and development. Also, there used to be weekly demos on Fridays to showcase completed modules.

Different technologies we used were PHP, React, Node, Python and some other frameworks. We followed microarchitecture as in there were more than 30 Repositories which were maintained. Repos were differentiated based on functionalities and their usage. For the front end, Google App engine was used and for the back end, google cloud run services were used. Databases were hosted on AWS because of pricing issues at Google. A combination of PGSQL and Mongodb was used. For Authentication combination of AWS Cognito and Auth0 was used. For payment Gateway Stripe was used. Deployments were made using Google's CI/CD service. We had multiple environments for staging, development and production.

Like most of the projects sometimes there used to be changes after design approval and implementation which was expected most of the time. Overall it was a good experience. I got to learn a lot.
