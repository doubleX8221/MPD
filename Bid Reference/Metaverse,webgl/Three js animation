Hey,

I reviewed the job description and understood what you want.

I specialize in UI/UX, Website design including all the specialties that you have mentioned in your job description, and can assist you with your projects. I have been working together for various clients, designing or re-designing websites for quite a while now. I've designed and developed many websites and I have done Custom CSS, SVG, GSAP, and three.js animation.

Please have a look at the following website where you can see the animation that I've done.

https://futuritybioventures.com/ (3D scroll animation) (three.js)
https://www.squadeasy.com/en/ (3D scroll animation) (GSAP)
https://cowboy.com/ (3D animation) (three.js)
http://corva.ai/ (2D Isos animation) (JSON, SVG)

Also for the modeling, I can help you with it as my Partner is a professional 3D artist and has 10 years of experience in the industry. Here's his portfolio to review:

I am aware of all the precautions to be taken because of the sensitivity of the project and I will definitely result in a perfect choice for this project.

Hoping to hear from you.

Thank you.
