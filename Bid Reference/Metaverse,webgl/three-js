Dynamic Animation (three.js)


Hi there,
I have done similar projects in Three.js, and can create a page like this where you upload the model, it will make a camera animation, record each frame, save to the server and then run a software like ffmpeg to compile the frames into a video and give you the link.
I'm more experienced in the three.js side of things, making everything look good with high quality, and the video conversion part I haven't done before, but I know in theory how it should work.
The different sizes might also present a challenge, or we set an height and width limit, or it's something manual that the user adjusts the scale before rendering.

Take a look at this Three.js page that we're building for KlimaDAO cryptocurrency, it's a three.js page that appears when the user scans a qr code, and it will display the carbon impact of their NFT in a 3d natural environment.

https://adn.aden.digital/threejs/
You can test running this function in chrome developer console to see the lipsync example:
LoadAudioWithViseme("https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.adn.ai/audio/speech01_en.mp3","https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.adn.ai/audio/speech01_en.marks");

Tere,

I will write a script that loads a model from a Database/File/URL, captures a video of the 360 of the model, and then saves it to a Database. The camera will adjust its zoom depending on the size of the product using raycasting on the edges of the product. I will use Puppeteer to generate the video of the 3d scene.
BEST WORK: 3D Shed Configurator App. https://youtu.be/eaiVPsXLUvg
About Me:
I specialize in interactive and configurable WebGL apps. I mainly use advanced
WebGL libraries like ThreeJs.
I can also implement server-side rendering using puppeteer. This can be useful if you want to generate the blueprint of the configured product or a 3d analysis data in PDF format(example generated blueprint attached below.) The same concept can be applied to generate a video of the scene.
Portfolio:
I am the sole developer of all the apps listed here.
3D shed Designer app: https://youtu.be/eaiVPsXLUvg
All the geometry and uvs are generated from code. The app generates modular
geometries and then assembles them like a lego house. This enables highly
dynamic interaction but is harder on the developer side as there is a lot of
mathematics involved.

Solar panel annual Yield estimator: https://youtu.be/vsdt_wr0bzo
users model their roofs on Google Maps and then the app places 3d solar
panels on their roofs. Users can control the direction and intensity of the sun to
get an annual yield from the solar panels
I also have metaverse projects under development. I am willing to share them
during interview

Hey,

I reviewed the job description and understood what you want but I would like to have a quick call session on Upwork so we can discuss this project in detail as this project needs to cover many areas on which I need to ask a few questions so I can give you suggestion and recommendations according to the feature and functionality that you require which is pretty moderate to build but with the right directions and guidelines it will be possible if we communicate efficiently.

I specialize in UI/UX, Website design including all the specialties that you have mentioned in your job description, and can assist you with your projects. I have been working together for various clients, designing or re-designing websites for quite a while now. I've designed and developed many websites and I have done Custom CSS, SVG, GSAP, and three.js animation.

Please have a look at the following website where you can see the animation that I've done.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16pIkPgvR90JyM1_YxcVOsXzigG--NhAP?usp=sharing

I am aware of all the precautions to be taken because of the sensitivity of the project and I will definitely result in a perfect choice for this project.

Hoping to hear from you.

Hi, For your project we would use rendered images of 360 rotation of the product. and in JS we would make a reaction to the movement of the mouse or finger to rotate the object. This would give maximum quality and more interaction with the user than video
How many products do you have in total?

I attached some of our works on 3d graphics for you to evaluate the quality.

Thanks,
Waiting for your answer

Hello, I have read your job posting and I know you are gonna convert fbx 3d modeling file from Blender to HTML web based application.
As a senior developer, I have rich experience in converting fbx, glb, gltf 3d modeling file to HTML web based application.
We can use WebGL for it and there are three.js, playcanvas, and babylon.js libraries.
Once, I check your fbx file, I will suggest a best option for it.
Looking forward to discuss in more detail via chat.
Thank you.

The Society for Neuroscience wanted to create a 3D Interactive Brain as part of the major rebrand of Brainfacts.org.
With funding from the Wellcome Trust, Matt Wimsatt and I combined our skills in 3D Medical Illustration and Interactive WebGL development to design and build an immersive, educational guide to the human brain.
As the sole developer on the project, my role extended from 3D model clean-up, custom python scripting, baked and live GLSL shader design, efficient web worker subdivision techniques and thoughtful interactive user experience.
The brain will continue to be updated and improved into a second phase, with updated neural circuits, more detailed 3D models, and improved code design.
The module is a huge part of the new Brainfacts website, with many links and presentations pointing to it for medical and educational reference.

Hello. I have extensive experience in creating complex projects from scratch including projects with complex 3D animations.

I've worked for the past five years almost exclusively with webGL/three.js. Jobs have included 3d model viewers, product configurators, bone-based animation, particle effects, procedural mesh generation, multi-layer 2D sprite environments, and motion capture/motion tracking for armature animation.

To expound upon the v.r. experience: While working on staff at the lab I was tasked with developing software for an accelerometer-based glove apparatus, learned about VR theory and methods of application, worked with a unity-like engine, and modeled in 3DStudioMax and Maya. I was also involved in the various upkeep and troubleshooting needs of a VR-capable network of nodes and projectors.
