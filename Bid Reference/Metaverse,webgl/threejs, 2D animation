Hello. I have extensive experience in creating complex projects from scratch including projects with complex 3D animations and 3D Models.

I've worked for the past five years almost exclusively with webGL/three.js. Jobs have included 3d model viewers, product configurators, bone-based animation, particle effects, procedural mesh generation, multi-layer 2D sprite environments, and motion capture/motion tracking for armature animation.

To expound upon the v.r. experience: While working on staff at the lab I was tasked with developing software for an accelerometer-based glove apparatus, learned about VR theory and methods of application, worked with a unity-like engine, and modeled in 3DStudioMax and Maya. I was also involved in the various upkeep and troubleshooting needs of a VR-capable network of nodes and projectors.
