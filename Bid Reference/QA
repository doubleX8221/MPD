As a software engineer, my approach to testing and improving QA involves several best practices that I have found to be successful. 

1. Test early and often: I believe in catching defects early in the development lifecycle, so I emphasize testing as soon as possible after code is written. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

2. Use a variety of testing methods: While automated testing is important, I also believe in the value of manual testing, exploratory testing, and crowdtesting to identify defects that might be missed by automated tests.

3. Plan properly to avoid wasting time: I believe in planning properly to set testing expectations, so that time isn't wasted on unnecessary testing. I emphasize risk-based testing, prioritization of features, and planning the types of test activities to be employed.

4. Involve QA as early as possible: I believe in the importance of involving QA as early as possible in the development cycle. This includes having QA review requirements, participate in daily stand-up meetings, and work with developers on test planning.

5. Continuously improve my methods and tooling: I continuously look for new and better ways to perform testing by experimenting with new methods, techniques, and tools, and conducting regular reviews and assessments of my own process.

Overall, my approach is focused on being proactive in identifying defects early, employing various testing methods to identify more defects, and continuously improving my testing methods and process.-Test eart
