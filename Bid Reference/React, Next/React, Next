Hello

I just read your job posting, and it sounds like you need a Senior React/Next.js developer.

Over 10 years of expert experience in Web development, at the beginning of my professional career using Javascript, Typescript, and around the last 5 years focusing on React and Next.js for the front-end part.
Next.js provides a backend that can server side render a response to request, allowing you to create a dynamic website, which means you will deploy it on a platform that can run Node.js.

I have also experience with Styled component, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, UI/UX

You can check my past projects
https://www.getswill.com/ React, Next.js
https://www.hashicorp.com/ React, Next.js

I adopted an Agile approach to deliver a fully functional product within the agreed timeframe.

I can work 40 hours a week, and I am available to conference with you.
Thank you,
Alberto
