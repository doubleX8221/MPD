Hi there!        
yeah I can work with svelte and its UI framework SvelteKit.        
        
professionally I am not a svelte developer, currently I am working with javascript and its framework React, but I can surely        
build an optimized version of your website in svelte.        
Because its framework of javascript and its similar to reactjs, thatswhy I have too just learn some new rules and syntax of        
svelte, it won't take more than few hours to learn rules.        
        
I have been working as a web developer for four years and I builds fully responsive,optimized and functional websites for        
individuals, brands and agencies.
