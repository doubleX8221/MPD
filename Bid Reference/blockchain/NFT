Hi, there.

I develop NFT using Solidity in ERC721/ERC1155 standards for Ethereum and other EVM compatible blockchains such as Polygon, BSC, Tron and others.
As well as NFT using Rust on Solana and Metaplex.

I would be happy to help with the development of the token itself, and with the creation of the NFT marketplace.
My projects have been for the GameFi industry, but I've also developed NFT for both betting and digital art.

Here are my previous projects:
- Decentralized NFT platform based on Solana - https://degenape.academy/
- Happy Quokkas NFT platform - https://minthappyquokkas.io
- Sci-FI Comic Book in NFT - https://mooningmonkey.com
- NFT game - https://gameofsnakes.com

If you have an idea and ready-made tokenomics, I would be happy to help and be a part of something amazing.

Could you please tell me more about your project?
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your time.
