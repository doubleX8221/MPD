Hi, there.

I can make bulletproof smart contracts that are fully optimized for your project.
Even more, I can handle all technical details of your project including the web part, design, and anything else, so you have time to do business and donâ€™t have to worry about the tech part.

Blockchain development is my bread and butter and I delivered a lot of cool projects, for example here is one similar to yours in terms of technical side:

http://ethx.ai/ - NFT Collection with soft staking to earn ERC20 tokens on Polygon and marketplace to spend your earned tokens. Sold out in 2 days and the community keeps growing after we added staking and marketplace.

And one more:
https://jellyz.io - soon to be launched NFT Collection with staking, breeding, mutating, games, and much more all fully on a blockchain.

If you are interested in working with me or if you want to get FREE insides about projects like yours, just shoot me a message here.

We will discuss your project and how to best implement it, develop key points that are critical for such projects, and will see if we are a good fit for each other to work together. Either way, you can get a great value out of it.

Thank you.
