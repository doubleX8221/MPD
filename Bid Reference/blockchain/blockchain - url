----I need a Blockchain Developer

----1----


Hey, if I am getting this correctly, you need a website where anything that is on sale is actually posted as a video / a stream, and users watch this and place their bids on it. If this is the case I have done something very very similar and I am actually building the app for it {can provide the whole detail on it if you need it}. So adding a smart contract won't be an issue. However, I would need to know more details, you mentioned Squarespace? Is the current website developed in Squarespace because that can cause issues? So let me know if we can have a call and discuss this thoroughly.

have a look at these couple of projects that I have worked on and developed:
https://gwallet.tech/ {A complete exchange}
https://dreamerz.io/ {NFT market place with mystery box features}
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cryptokara&hl=en&gl=US A complete wallet app.

Thanks!

Hello there!
My name is Alex, I'm a full stack blockchain developer from Unistory.
In general, our team specializes in different web3 projects, and, by the way, we're developing NFT Marketplace for one of the London galleries with English and Dutch auction functionality. Think that skills we gained from this project will be definitely useful on your!

Talking about your project, first of all, I'd like to see your current platform for sure! Is it blockchain related as well? Would be great, if you could share as more information about it as it possible.
I want to warn you right away - that's not a really good idea to integrate smart contracts and other blockchain parts into Squarespace website.
Firstly, most of the existing plugins do not work well enough and there may be numerous bugs when upgrading. Secondly, you cut yourself off from the scalability - if you want to add functionality that is not implemented in any of the plugins, you will have to rewrite all the code, which is very long and expensive. That would be much easier and cheaper to rebuild the whole platform with frameworks or just add new pages separately from your website (with auction for example), that built on frameworks.
Anyway, I would be glad to discuss everything in detail during the call or on a chat together! Think we definitely find the most suitable way of development!

For now, take a look at some of my previous NFT/Blockchain projects that I've design and partially developed:
https://neuralpepe.com - It's an NFT project that generates the images using Artificial Intelligence. It also has the local $AI token that I've listed on several DEXs
https://theheistgame.io - It’s a P2E NFT game, in which you can assemble a team of robbers from the popular series Money Heist. Also here you can find the NFT collection, which you can use to play the game!
https://millionpieces.io - Here you can find the DAO in which users have the opportunity to mint the virtual land, insert any image in there and even merge it!

Hello there!
My name is Alex, I'm the fullstack blockchain developer with over 5 years of relevant experience. I'm pretty familiar with smart contract development, TRON blockchain and backend development, so I'll be glad to provide you my skills and knowledge :)

To start with, I'd like to understand the scope of work on your project. Here're the queistions I have:
1) What is the general idea of your future platform? What will be its functionality?
2) Have you got a design concept for the project? Maybe you've got some references?
3) Have you got a project documentation or project description so I can understand what exactly needs to be done?

Take a look at some of my previous NFT/Blockchain projects I've developed (including the smart contracts):
1) https://neuralpepe.com - It's an NFT project that generates the images using Artificial Intelligence. It also has the local $AI token that I've listed on several DEX's

3) https://millionpieces.io - It's my own NFT project and here you can find the DAO in which users have the opportunity to mint the virtual land, insert any image in there and even merge it!

Chat me back to discuss all details of your future project!

Hello, Happy to place a bid here.
Do you have any experience with Opensea? most of marketplaces have bid/auction system. owner of NFT item - assets would create a auction, then buyers will place a bid with more amount then last bid. When auction would finish, last bidder will be winner.
That is basic blockchain part, hope to discuss in detail more.

Let's have a quick call?

Whilst on the call, we can dive deeper and provide answers to the questions you have.
------------------------------------------------------------
I don’t usually look for new clients, but your post took my attention since I’ve recently finished a similar project with web3 integration & custom blockchain platform development (DEX).

Here is what my recent client says:

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “Ilya is a real asset to the project - often on Upwork when you hire an engineer full-time you taking a lot of risk on - a freelancer might ghost you and for some reason, it happens at the most important parts of the project, might not have proper communication, might be outsourcing the work to someone else, at the end of the day he just might not write good code and not be efficient in what he does - worst-case scenario if he’s not tracking time properly & work just to bill you hours. With Ilya we had no issues like that - the process he uses is awesome - daily stand-ups, regular check-ins, all-time clear communication, a separate tracking system that checks the activity & the tasks delivered is awesome - a new level of experience in comparison to everyone I’ve worked with on Upwork so far.”

Surely you’re looking for someone reliable, who can be with you all the time, have clear communication, someone who knows the industry very well & can consult you on implementations & security issues.

Maybe this will be a perfect fit for us. I expect people to give business their all, and I return the favor. If you’re truly passionate about this, let’s hop on a call.

There, I showcase my previous experience with regard to blockchain engineering & projects like yours.

I also provide case studies of some of my previous clients.

And lastly, I describe exactly the reasons why you should go with me, over someone else.

Experienced blockchain engineer spends 30% of their time developing & 70% of time testing.

I know exactly what CertiK does with their smart contract audit system & can set up the same thing.

Security is a huge issue with newcomers in the industry, get someone who would not screw up many months of development & hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Reply to this message to set up a time to chat.

Kind Regards,
Ilya

Hi,

https://activity.treasureland.market/

As a Blockchain developer, I specialize in NFT smart contracts, Minting, Staking, and NFT marketplace development. I am familiar with Rust, Solidity, Web3.js, Web3-solana, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Nest.js, Netlify, Heroku, and AWS. I have rich experience with Solana, BSC, Polygon, Ethereum, and Fantom networks.

The main thing I focus on when working with my clients is communication. This is the basis of all healthy and successful business relationships. I have a 100% success track record with my clients and take into consideration their time when performing any job.

I would like the opportunity for an interview to make your vision a reality on the internet.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,

Hi,

I've spent 10+ years designing and developing award-winning mobile & web apps that are fast, attractive, responsive, and easy to use.

I have thousands of hours logged on UpWork with a 100% success score, and I'm Top Rated Plus (Top 3% of ALL Upwork!) Some of the work I've done has been featured by Apple, Google, TechRadar, and the New York Times!

In 2009, I started the largest mobile fitness app at the time called Fitivity, which achieved over 15 million downloads and raised $1.5 million.

Since starting Valere Labs, we have been heavily focused in the Crypto & NFT space.

As you probably already know, finding GOOD crypto/blockchain/NFT developers right now that are available and not backlogged for months is nearly impossible.

With that being said, we only pick projects that we have a strong affection for, and I think this project is the right fit for us.

Here are a few recent completed projects that showcase our diverse skills in the blockchain space:

https://valeunleashed.com
We helped Vale Unleashed mimic a Pokemon battle with NFTs. User’s can buy, battle, and upgrade their Vale NFTs. Test your skills against other players on the internet, or battle locally with play-to-earn PVP/PVE gameplay. We not only helped them build their product, but also interact with their social community to build hype!

https://mowsse.com
We helped Mowsse create the first complete NFT marketplace and auction house for real artists. We also helped them create their own Crypto Currency which is used to make purchases on platform: BLOK. That is why we really created an entire blockchain ecosystem. Mowsse recruits and verifies famous artists who turn their work into NFT’s. Consumers can shop around, and list their own NFT’s up for sale and auction. Their next major artist they are getting on the platform is J Lo!

https://cryptohomes.com
We helped Crypto Homes create the first fully functional marketplace to buy and sell homes using crypto currency!

https://lucky-monks-fe.herokuapp.com
We helped Lucky Monks create their custom NFT minting site in record speed. We created this site so it could be built upon, just like the NFT upgradeable smart contracts involved. This allows for more flexibility in the future for utility NFTs.


Due to the huge demand, I would need you to get back to me within 48 hours to reserve the spot to work with us. Then, I would like to get on a quick intro call to see if this is a 100% fit for both of us.

I also attached a PDF that explains some more about Valere Labs, our non-crypto projects we have done, and how we like to work with people!

I look forward to chatting with you and learning more about the vision.

Hello,

My name is Stanislav, I'm leading the Trembit team, we specialize in video streaming platforms development.

Currently, we are helping two eCommerce streaming startups to develop their solutions.

For this type of streaming, you would need to use the lowest latency streaming provider, based on the scale of the events and streaming costs, which might be Twilio or Red5Pro for example.

What kind of payment provider do you plan to integrate? Stripe? Paypal?

How do you want to integrate Blockchain into all of that? As a type of payment or somehow in another way?

Best regards
Stanislav

Happy Monday, :)

I saw you are looking to build a crypto website

I sent the application to this job post because I’ve been obsessed with crypto and blockchain for almost 5 years and I feel that a new crypto website can make a great positive impact in the crypto space

I also know how confusing and overwhelming it is to deal all the complexities in such a project, and to find good talent that knows what they are talking about.

Here are some examples of my work that I have developed in the past that accomplish similar outcomes to your own project:

www.sloppybees.com - NFT Website, minting logic, frontend connection and smart contract
www.digitaltwinclub.com - NFT Website, minting logic and frontend connection, and smart contract

https://opensea.io/collection/the-cyclops-monkey-club - Smart contract written
https://opensea.io/collection/nft-the-companion - Smart contract Written

Besides being a crypto expert, i’ve also been a software developer for 10 years, having worked with clients around the world such as Burger King in the US and The Trainline in the UK, and I’m confident i’m capable of providing you a premium service on the technical part, so that you can focus solely on growing your crypto business.

Here’s what you can expect:
1. Fully Tested Smart Contracts, so that your dapp is bulletproof secure
2. Cutting Edge Web 3.0 Development, providing your users with fast and intuitive user experiences on hour Dapps
3. Timely Delivers
4. Constant and Clear Communication

I always make a point to deliver the work in time and top quality is my number one priority, so choose to work only with a few clients at each time

It is also very important to me to work with clients who have a long-term vision for their business and are passionate about it. If that sounds like you, I'll be more than happy to get to know more of you and figure out if we're a good fit

I offer you an invitation for a free consultation call where :
 
I will give feedback on your current development/design practices & strategies. I will also share my own process for delivering safe and performant crypto projects

You can choose the day and the time in the calendar link down below and i will call you in upwork ;)

https://danielsilvacrypto.youcanbook.me/

The budget proposed is a placeholder. We need to investigate the scope of the project
------------------------------------------------------------
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Greetings!
Thank you for this job opportunity.

We are a team of professional developers and designers with already more than 11 years of industry experience and ready to help you greatly with any work needed for this project.

Let me demonstrate one of our recently developed Cryptocurrency/Blockchain/Web3 projects. Insight Prediction is a betting platform for different events (markets). Users get wallets for different crypto coins (USDC, BTC, ETH) to deposit money into the system, place bids for different events and convert between different crypto coins to withdraw the money from their account.
1. Perform complex calculations for share creation, as well as the resolved markets.
2. Show statistics on the profits, ROI, and the harmonic average based on the ranking.
3. While migrating markets from other platforms, convert into the respective format to be able to import into our platform.
4. Ensure a total synchronization of the platforms so that the market is updated immediately in our platform whenever it gets updated in the original platform. We have used WebSocket to ensure this synchronization. Please check the link below:
https://insightprediction.com/

So, let me suggest you to schedule a date and meet online to discuss our candidacy and some more project details as well, what do you think?

Looking forward to working with you in the nearest future.

Best regards,

https://nymcard.com/ – another good example of our capabilities (illustrations, animations & front-end)
https://getclair.com/ – Clair is a platform to pay employees the moment they clock out of work while giving them exceptional banking services. I was involved in the front-end development of the app and the internal administrative tool, heavily integrating it with the back-end team.
https://sortly.com/ – Sortly is an inventory management SaaS solution that enables businesses and teams to easily track what they have, where it is, and who has it. I refined an existing platform, built a comprehensive design system, implemented an updated UX approach through all platforms. 
https://yesplz.ai/ – Yesplz is a silicon valley startup that provides an e-commerce recommendation engine for fashion retail. I helped to design, build, and deploy the minimum viable product, as well as most of the marketing materials and the tailor-made website.

P.S. We are not a classic agency — there are no account managers or other transactional costs associated with overhead — more like a cozy and creative space for a supportive environment.

Let's set up a call and discuss the details, I will answer all your questions. At your convenience?

Hi,

I just read your posting which caught my attention as Software Development is my speciality!

I've worked with companies of all size, from startup to some of the top brands around the world on a wide variety of tasks like API integrations, App, Web and plugin development just to name a few.

I'm based in London and have been doing this for the last 14 years. I can help you with all aspects of your project from identifying your brand and design all the way through to the delivery of the development.

I am sure you will quickly see the advantage of hiring me once we jump on a call and discuss your project. I can bring years of experience to the table.

I've got some free resources and time to take on a new client now, I can only take on a couple of new projects each month. So if this sounds of interest to you, drop me a message so we can have a quick FREE consultation call.

Best regards
Sean

------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, we can definitely build your NFT mobile app on iOS & Android - as we have designed, developed, and published 100s of iOS & Android mobile apps by working with many clients like you.

We can start straight away, and in under 9 weeks, we can design the UI/UX, develop the full stack mobile app and publish it on both Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The time frame will be 1 week designing, 6-7 weeks developing, 1-2 weeks testing and deployment.

Let’s book a call to see if we could be a good fit.

Warm regards,
Ronak

Hi there, it’s nice to meet you, I’m Damiano. I am also the owner of Cryptopunk #3359 and I love the NFT and crypto space :)

I’m the founder and CEO of Startup Slang, a web development & strategy firm out of Toronto, Canada. I take a quick look through job posts on Upwork every day, and from first glance I believe I can definitely help you with your project.

My team of web development specialists has over 10 years of experience, and we put an extra focus on strategy above blind execution. We’re here to advise our partners as much as we can, putting our industry expertise on the line to give a project (and often business model) it’s best chance at success.

Since you’re looking for crypto/web3 related work, there’s a few things you should know.

We take these projects on a case-by-case basis currently, because reputation is very important in this industry. Hopefully your project has all the right ingredients to be the next success story in these early days of this market!

Our team has partnered on many technically challenging Web3 projects, which you can browse through here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/15fxe85I42uHW5WavV6YDuQp66Cc0aRQO/view?usp=sharing

So, are you ready to work with a development expert that is focused on helping you grow your business?
How about one that has worked on over 2000 brands in 30 different countries?

Although we have our favorites, we’ve worked in many verticals (including construction, beauty, fashion, home decor, healthcare, social media, etc) and while we’ve completed projects for enterprise brands such as Dyson & Panasonic, we take on startup partners all the time.

You can have a look at our reviews and ratings to learn more about what kind of company we are. Our focus from day 1 has been on communication, kaizen service improvement, and above all pushing the limits of what’s possible in online commerce!

We’re ready to talk to you this week, if you have a quick 10-30 minutes.

THERE’S A BOOKING LINK below, to get you started. I’ve found that other ways of setting up an initial chat never quite work out, so this is how we do things for now.

Our conversation will be on Upwork chat, using the “start call” feature, and we’ll proceed from there if you like what you hear.

No two businesses are quite the same, so let’s discuss what’s top-of-mind for you and what can be done given your situation!

PS, the above quotation is a loose guess / bid… unfortunately the best I can do without being able to ask you some questions (and follow up questions).

You can pick a time that’s convenient for our call HERE:


> https://go.oncehub.com/upwork <<
> THEN REPLY to this proposal so we can find you for the call! <<


Our accounts team is fully trained on design strategies and up to date best dev practices, so I know that once you leave that call, you’ll feel like you’ve got a great team to count on and a solid game plan to execute.

We can’t wait to get you started!

All the best,
Damiano & the Startup Slang team

Have a great day.

Best wishes.

Hi,

With our expertise in **Software development** and extensive experience in building **Web3/ NFT/ Ethereum/ Solana/ Smart Contract/ Blockchain-based Applications**, we believe our abilities would be ===PERFECT=== for this job.

**Let's schedule a meeting to have a quick call to discuss your requirements in detail so we can come up with our feedback, recommendations, & estimated time along with the detailed proposal.**

**ABOUT OUR TEAM AND EXPERIENCE:**
===============================
We have a relatively young team, keen to take on challenges. We are building a Web3 consulting capability, and we have some capacity available at the moment to start a project.

We have helped customers, delivering consultancy on whitepapers, tokenomics, funding models, valuation models, and DAO conformation.

In terms of programming, we have done NFTs, Land registration, real estate valuations and collateralization for Defi, proof of existence, and interactions with staking Defi protocols. We have experience in ETH, SOL, BNB, and Hyperledger that we use for enterprises and governments.

**SOME HIGH-LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PROJECTS, WE WORKED ON:**
===========================================================
> We have done consultancy engagements for developing whitepapers that include the full tokenomics for Web3 platforms dedicated to specific industry domains, for example, consignment auctions, job markets, and social networks.

> We are also involved in a government land registration platform, creating and introducing blockchain technology to ensure transparency and audibility. An important non is sponsoring the project for-profit worldwide organization.

> In addition, we are in the first stage of developing eco-systems for NTFS for real-state management.

> We are helping one customer is designing that allows us to transact and manage a pool of rights of ownership of properties as NFTs

> Another customer is designing NFTs to represent ownership rights, generate collateralization of a property, and earn yield based on crypto loans staked in a partner Defi platform.

> We had several opportunities in the Defi space. For example, be involved in Yield Farming projects; in another case, clone DEX (Sushi-swap) with the implicit intention of attacking other DEX exchanges (vampire attack).

For more information, please have a look at the attached file including our **WEB 3.0 CAPABILITIES**

**DEVELOPMENT PROCESS**
========================

**We follow a well-documented development process starting with a hybrid approach in which we gather requirements, document them, work on UI/UX, and finally move to development, test planning & execution, and deployment. Here is a detailed breakdown of our deployment process:**

- Requirement Gathering & Documentation: Hosting brainstorming sessions to understand your idea and prepared detailed documentation based on this understanding.

- User Experience & Design Thinking: Using the user experience and design thinking to bring innovative solutions and the best customer experience onboard.

- Development: Following an agile approach consisting of bi-weekly sprint planning, well-defined tasks, weekly reviews, sprint retrospectives.

- Test Planning & Execution: Using SonarQube to enhance code quality, writing unit test cases to reduce issues, and ship a stable product into the market.

- Deployment: Building an end-to-end DevOps strategy. Creating the whole infrastructure as the script using Terraform. We follow the CI/CD approach to achieve continuous integration & deployment.

We look forward to working with you and build a long-lasting working relationship.
