Hi there,

You're looking for an expert game developer for your NFT gaming project. I can help you sidestep the unqualified people clogging your inbox.

Assuming we’re a good fit, I can help you with this.

I've generated millions in sales for my clients, learn more here: https://bit.ly/Ryan_Upwork_Profile

I’ve been involved in blockchain development since 2017, coding since I was 12 (23 years), I was a ranking Captain and Physicist in the United States Air Force, CTO & CEO at a few technology companies, and I’m more passionate about crypto and blockchain than anyone you’ll meet.

If you’re looking to discuss your project further, let’s hop on a quick call.

Feel free to pick a time for us to talk on Upwork here: https://go.oncehub.com/upwork
Let me know when you chose a time so I know you read this and we can chat! :)

Hi there, it’s nice to meet you, I’m Damiano. I own Cryptopunk #3359 and my company is now a technology project leader in the crypto space :)

I’m the founder and CEO of Startup Slang, a web development & strategy firm out of Toronto, Canada. I take a quick look through job posts on Upwork every day, and from first glance I believe I can definitely help you with your project.

My team of web development specialists has over 10 years of experience, and we put an extra focus on strategy above blind execution. We’re here to advise our partners as much as we can, putting our industry expertise on the line to give a project (and often business model) its best chance at success.

Since you’re looking for crypto/web3 related work, there’s a few things you should know.

We take these projects on a case-by-case basis currently, because reputation is very important in this industry. Hopefully your project has all the right ingredients to be the next success story in these still early days of this market!

Our team has partnered on many technically challenging Web3 projects, which you can browse through here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/15fxe85I42uHW5WavV6YDuQp66Cc0aRQO/view?usp=sharing

Since our founding in 2017, my team has worked with over 2000 brands in 30 different countries, and I really hope we can work with yours as well.

Although we have our favorites, we’ve worked in many verticals (including construction, beauty, fashion, home decor, healthcare, social media, etc) and while we’ve completed projects for enterprise brands such as Dyson & Panasonic, we take on startup partners all the time.

You can have a look at our reviews and ratings to learn more about what kind of company we are. Our focus from day 1 has been on communication, kaizen service improvement, and above all pushing the limits of what’s possible in online commerce!

We’re ready to talk to you this week, if you have a quick 10-30 minutes.

THERE’S A BOOKING LINK below, to get you started. I’ve found that other ways of setting up an initial chat never quite work out, so this is how we do things for now.

Our conversation will be on Upwork chat, using the “start call” feature, and we’ll proceed from there if you like what you hear.

No two businesses are quite the same, so let’s discuss what’s top-of-mind for you and what can be done given your situation!

PS, the above quotation is a loose guess / bid… unfortunately the best I can do without being able to ask you some questions (and follow up questions).

You can pick a time that’s convenient for our call HERE:


> https://go.oncehub.com/upwork <<
> THEN REPLY to this proposal so we can find you for the call! <<


Our accounts team is fully trained on design strategies and up to date best dev practices, so I know that once you leave that call, you’ll feel like you’ve got a great team to count on and a solid game plan to execute.

We can’t wait to get you started!

All the best,
Damiano & the Startup Slang team

Describe your recent experience with similar projects

Here is a list of projects that I was working on:

1. herebefore100k.com - 50k tokens NFT collection.The project was not successful because guys didn't invest in marketing at all, but development-wise it was an interesting thing to do.
2. retropandas.com - community-based NFT collection of 3k retro pandas with passive yielding and breeding. Very similar to cyberkongz in terms of smart contract logic.
3. sosvengers.com - first NFT collection with minting using SOS tokens.
4. etherdash.space - NFT-based lottery-like game where you have to mint rocket parts and claim specific combinations of them to win prizes.
5. nftyea.io - ERC1155 tokens for membership in news project for NFT space, using polygon as blockchain and wETH for minting.
6. www.popknights.io - NFT-based hybrid game with prizes using ERC20 tokens and off-chain game mechanics. All blockchain development is finished, right now in the marketing phase before the launch.
7. www.winemutts.com - NFT collection of 5k tokens with passive yielding and breeding. Again, kind of similar to cyberkongz in terms of smart contract logic. Development is done, going to be launched in April.

These are not all projects, but they can give you nice image of what type of projects I’m most experienced with.

Please list any certifications related to this project

I don't know any certifications that are legit in this field.

Include a link to your GitHub profile and/or website

https://github.com/skakovskyi

Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

For QA I usually use a combination of unit and manual testing. For smart contracts, I always make sure that each line of code and piece of logic is covered with unit tests to make sure that there are no errors and bugs in the code. This approach is critical for me and I try to not work on projects that are neglecting unit testing of smart contracts. For other parts, I and other team members perform manual testing, for example, testing of a website UI and functionality using smart contracts that are deployed on a testnet. In the case of a long-term project, it is always a good idea to write integration and automated UI tests, this allows to not perform manual testing each time.

I can make bulletproof smart contracts that are fully optimized for your project.
Even more, I can handle all technical details of your project including the web part, design, and anything else, so you have time to do business and don’t have to worry about the tech part.
Blockchain development is my bread and butter and I delivered a lot of cool projects, for example here is one similar to yours in terms of technical side:
http://ethx.ai/ - NFT Collection with soft staking to earn ERC20 tokens on Polygon and marketplace to spend your earned tokens. Sold out in 2 days and the community keeps growing after we added staking and marketplace.
And one more:
https://jellyz.io - soon to be launched NFT Collection with staking, breeding, mutating, games, and much more all fully on a blockchain.
If you are interested in working with me or if you want to get FREE insides about projects like yours, just schedule a call with me by this link:
https://skakovskyi.youcanbook.me/?POST=013f55f9908fb1a906. We will discuss your project and how to best implement it, develop key points that are critical for such projects, and will see if we are a good fit for each other to work together. Either way, you can get a great value out of it.
Best regards, Roman
P.S. Price in the proposal is just a placeholder; we will figure out the actual price on a call when I know more details about your project.

www.bonzaiappdevelopment.com and jarbly.com/web

Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

- While we develop the website/app we provide screenshots and videos of our progress.
- Once the build is finished, we make sure everything works properly and there are no
glitches with functionality
- We then provide you a test build to actually test the website/application on your
device. 
- You will have the opportunity to provide revisions and feedback based on the test build
not aligning with the mockup functionality that was created with the graphics from
screen to screen and the specifications outlined in this agreement. We are very friendly
to make sure you are happy and the app works as promised. . 
- If you want any customizable features after that point we simply charge an a la carte
rate where we quote revisions on a task by task basis. We are very friendly and are
accommodating with our prices in case you need any additional integrations or
configurations but we work with our customers to make them satisfied and are very
friendly.

Describe your recent experience with similar projects

I have worked on many important projects throughout my career. What's really crucial for me when starting one is to get very clear on the goals right at the start and then create a plan with milestones. I also like dealing with the most difficult parts of the projects early on—that way in case there are any significant issues, I'll still have a nice amount of time to complete before the deadline.

I would strongly appreciate it if we could discuss it during the interview since I believe that every separate case requires its own approach depending on technical requirements, use cases, etc.

Would you consider https://gillionapes.com/ & https://meta-sphere.io/ as a strong experience in crypto game development? No? Just skip this proposal then.
Find the cases above decent enough? Let me share a bit more info about our experience in the NFT domain.

We're WINDNFIRE - a team of ex-bored ape designers, crypto influencers, and crypto marketers that provides full-cycle NFT/Metaverse design, development, and promotion services from concept to community building and technical maintenance.
https://windnfire.com/

Use Cases (the ones that aren't under NDA): Bored Ape Yach Club CARDS, SuperFarm, Aiko, Gillionapes, Meta-sphere, and more.
NFT Projects: 30 +
Characters: 250 K + randomized characters
Volume trade: 30000+ ETH
Also, you can find a good bunch of examples in my portfolio representing our designers' and developers' capabilities.

The job description sounds clear; however, to serve you better, it would be beneficial to know more about your concept, deadlines, vision of the process, etc. For example, let's have a chat or hop on a quick call to discuss these mentioned.

Have a great day,
