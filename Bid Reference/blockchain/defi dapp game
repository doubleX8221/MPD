Hello,

My passion is blockchain-related web development projects.
My basic stack is React.js for frontend, Node.js and Golang for backend.
During my work I faced requests for frontend and backend development in different industries: DeFi ecosystems, wallets, NFT marketplaces, trading systems and exchanges (both centralized and decentralized), gambling (betting, casino, poker, lotteries), governance platforms, etc.

Please take a look at my previous projects:
1. Cryptocurrency wallet extension similar to Metamask - https://equal.tech/
2. Wallet, dashboard - https://pwawallet.fantom.network
3. Social cross-platform dApp - https://savl.com
4. Betting platform - https://wagerr.com
5. DeFi platform- https://xbe.finance/

Do you have any materials or documented requirements ready for your project?
Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
