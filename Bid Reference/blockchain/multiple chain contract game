Hello there,

Looking for an EXPERT, seems like you found one! Being a PRO, I have extensive expertise on multiple blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, and polygon. I have worked on solidity for Ethereum and polygon. Along with this, I am familiar with multiple standards of Ethereum like ERC20 for fungible tokens and ERC721 for NFT and ERC1155 for an updated version of both NFT and fungible tokens. I have deployed contracts on both testnets and mainnet chains and have expertise with the web3 library for react to communicate with blockchain smart contracts by using specific wallets.

Please refer to my work on NFT MARKETPLACE and NFT-BASED PvP BATTLE GAME.
