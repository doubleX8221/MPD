### Wrap-Up (1 minute)

"Thanks for sharing all of that! We’ll review the details and get back to you soon. If you have any questions about the role or the company, feel free to ask now or reach out afterward."

Ok, thanks for sharing your background and experience. We will verify your details and get back to you soon. The next step is the technical interview. Before that, you need to take a short coding test.
Let me know your github username so I can add you to our repository.

Good, clone that project and execute it on your locally. I have to check what our project is working on your local properly.
After this meeting I have to report it to our team what you are ready for coding test on our project,

Since you want the test assessment to be based on your ongoing **Blockchain Card Battle game** project, here’s a tailored test task that fits within your current needs:

---

### **Blockchain Developer Test Assessment**

**Objective:**
Assess the candidate’s ability to contribute directly to your ongoing **Blockchain Card Battle game** project by working on specific tasks related to UI upgrade, wallet integration, and smart contracts.

**Task:**
1. **UI Enhancement**:
   - **Upgrade a specific UI component** in the existing game interface. For example, improve the design and responsiveness of the **game card layout** or **battle arena**.
   - Ensure the UI is clean, functional, and consistent with the existing style. Focus on **responsiveness** across different devices.

2. **Web3 Wallet Integration**:
   - Integrate a **web3 modal** into the game to connect multiple wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Sui Wallet).
   - Ensure the modal supports wallet switching and updates the user's connection status in real-time on the UI.
   - Provide feedback when a wallet is connected or disconnected.
   - Push the result to 'staging' branch

3. **Smart Contract Interaction**:
   - Using the existing **Sui chain**, create or modify a **smart contract** that allows the user to **mint an NFT**. The NFT could represent a game card or other in-game asset.
   - Ensure the game reflects the minted NFT in the player's inventory after minting.
   
4. **Token Implementation (Bonus)**:
   - (Optional) Integrate functionality where the player can receive a set number of tokens (your custom token) when they connect their wallet. Display the updated token balance in their account dashboard.

**Requirements**:
- The task should be implemented in the existing **MERN stack** setup with integration to the **Sui blockchain**.
- Use the provided **GitHub repository** for version control and collaboration.
- Document any code changes clearly in a README.md file with instructions on how to test the updated game features.

**Duration**:
- The task should take **4-6 hours** to complete.

---

### **Next Steps (Technical Interview)**:
1. **Code Review**: Have the candidate walk through the changes they made to the project, explaining the logic behind their choices.
2. **Test the Integration**: Ask them to demo the updated game, showing wallet connections, NFT minting, and the UI upgrades.
3. **Debugging Questions**: If they encountered issues, ask how they resolved them and what improvements they would suggest for the project going forward.

This approach will test their ability to jump into your existing codebase, understand the project’s architecture, and contribute to real features you're planning to implement.

When explaining your plan to develop the smart contract for your Blockchain Card Battle game, you want to clearly outline the core elements and your expectations for how the smart contract will function. Here's how you could explain it:

---

### **1. Overview of the Game and Smart Contract Role**
"Our Blockchain Card Battle game is built on the Sui chain, and one of the key components of the upgrade is the development of smart contracts that will power several new features. These smart contracts will govern in-game assets, such as our new NFTs, tokens, and facilitate wallet connections for users."

### **2. Key Features of the Smart Contract**
**A. NFT Integration:**  
"We plan to introduce a new set of NFTs for the game. These NFTs will represent unique in-game items, such as battle cards or assets players can collect and trade. The smart contract will handle minting, ownership transfers, and metadata for these NFTs. The design should follow the Sui standard for NFTs and include secure methods for players to exchange them."

**B. Custom Token Development:**  
"We will also introduce our custom token, which players can earn, spend, or trade within the game ecosystem. The smart contract will need to manage token minting, distribution, and ensure security for token transfers between users. We’ll need functionality for in-game rewards and potentially staking mechanics."

**C. Web3 Wallet Integration:**  
"The smart contract needs to support integration with multiple wallets. We're aiming to add a Web3 modal that will allow users to connect different wallets, ensuring that our system recognizes various wallets and facilitates smooth in-game transactions using NFTs and tokens."

**D. Game Mode Expansion (Roulette & Others):**  
"One of our goals is to expand the game with additional modes, like a roulette game. This will require a smart contract that can handle real-time gameplay interactions, ensuring fairness, randomness (verifiable random functions or oracles), and securely managing bets and payouts using our custom token."

### **3. Security and Gas Optimization**
"We expect the smart contracts to follow best practices for security, including audits to ensure there are no vulnerabilities. Additionally, gas optimization is crucial to minimize transaction fees for our users. We want to design the contracts in a way that maximizes efficiency on the Sui chain."

### **4. Testing and Deployment Plan**
"Once the smart contracts are developed, we’ll begin testing on a testnet to identify any issues. After successful testing, we’ll move to mainnet deployment, ensuring everything works as expected in a live environment. Continuous testing will also be done to check for any edge cases or bugs."

---

### **5. Expected Collaboration**
"You’ll be working closely with Milan and the rest of the team to ensure the smart contract integrates smoothly with our current backend infrastructure. We also expect daily status updates on progress, potential issues, and suggestions for improvements."

This structure covers both the technical and project management aspects of the smart contract development plan. Make sure to adapt based on any specific requirements or questions the developer may have during the meeting.
